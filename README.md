# TCT Linear And Discrete
## _Time cost trade-off analysis in project scheduling_

A C++ Utility to get the most feasible solutions for scheduling a project given time and cost constraints.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [C++] - Programming language used to write the utility.
- [COIN-OR](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) - COIN-OR utility to solve linear programming problem (CBC).
- [Linux] - Env to run the utility.

## Pre-requisite
Install CbC (a coin-or project) used to solve the linear programming problem.
Lookup (https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) for how to install.

For production environments...

```sh
g++ -I path_to_tct_linear_n_discrete.cpp_file -o tct_linear_n_discrete
```

## Development
TBA
